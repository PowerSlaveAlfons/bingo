	<info title="viceci" description="Probably need to establish some concrete rules for less vagueness. Here's some I can think of:
If your game crashes after finishing an objective it will still count as completed and you don't have to redo.
If your game crashes during an objective (eg. while collecting packages) you must start over. So if you collected 14 out of 20 packages, then crash, you must collect those 14 packages again, rather than just the remaining 6. (I think, people please confirm this rule) -- I agree
Also you aren't allowed to reset the game to do objectives you lock yourself out (like mhmd did to do Drive Misty for me with a dodo), unless you reset your whole bingo card.
